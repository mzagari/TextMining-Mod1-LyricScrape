    "This assignment requires you to have a version of Tweepy that is at least version 4. The latest version is 4.10 as I write this. Critically, this version of Tweepy is *not* on the upgrade path from Version 3, so you will not be able to simply upgrade the package if you are on Version 3. Instead you will need to explicitly install version 4, which you can do with a command like this: `pip install \"tweepy>=4\"`. You will also be using Version 2 of the Twitter API for this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the below cell. If your version of Tweepy begins with a \"4\", then you should be good to go. If it begins with a \"3\" then run the following command, found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5226311/installing-specific-package-version-with-pip), at the command line or in a cell: `pip install -Iv tweepy==4.9`. (You may want to update that version number if Tweepy has moved on past 4.9. "

This function has a parameter, `max_results`, that we can use to change the number of followers that we pull. Unfortunately, we can only pull 1000 followers at a time, which means we will need to handle the _pagination_ of our results. \n",

    "Twitter limits the rates at which we can pull data, as detailed in [this guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits). We can make 15 user requests per 15 minutes, meaning that we can pull $4 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 1000 = 60000$ users per hour. I illustrate the handling of rate limiting below, though whether or not you hit that part of the code depends on your value of `handle`.  \n",
